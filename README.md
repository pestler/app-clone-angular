## API Interaction (Firestore)

The application primarily interacts with Firebase Firestore as its backend. Below is an overview of how the application's services interact with Firestore, serving as its API.

### Overview

- The application uses Firebase Firestore as its backend.
- Data interaction is primarily handled through `FirestoreService` and other domain-specific services (`AuthService`, `UserService`, `CourseService`, `DashboardService`).

### Key Services and their Firestore Interactions

#### `FirestoreService`

Provides generic methods for interacting with Firestore collections and documents.

- `getCollection(path, converter)`: Fetches a collection of documents.
- `getDoc(path, docId, converter)`: Fetches a single document.
- `setDoc(path, docId, data)`: Sets or updates a document.
- `getCollectionCount(path)`: Retrieves the count of documents in a specified collection.
- `getFilteredCollectionCount(path, field, value)`: Retrieves the count of documents in a collection based on a filter.

#### `AuthService`

Handles user authentication and retrieves user-specific course data.

- `getScoreData(courseAlias)`: Retrieves a student's score data for a specific course from the `courses/{courseAlias}/students/{githubId}` path.

#### `UserService`

Manages user profile data.

- `getUserProfile(githubId)`: Retrieves a user's profile from the `users/{githubId}` path.
- `saveUserProfile(githubId, data)`: Saves or updates a user's profile.
- `doesUserProfileExist(githubId)`: Checks for the existence of a user profile.

#### `CourseService`

Manages course-related data.

- `getCourses()`: Fetches all available courses from the `courses` collection.

#### `DashboardService`

Aggregates and processes data for the student dashboard.

- `getDashboardData(student, courseAlias)`: Gathers various data points for the student dashboard, fetching information from `courses/{courseAlias}/students/{githubId}/taskResults`, `courses/{courseAlias}/tasks`, and `courseStatistics`.

### Firestore Converters: Your Data's Translator

Imagine your app speaks TypeScript (with its nice, structured objects) and Firestore speaks its own database language (simple key-value pairs). Converters are like a special translator that helps these two talk to each other smoothly!

**What they do:**
When you send data from your app to Firestore, the converter takes your TypeScript object and turns it into something Firestore understands. When you get data back from Firestore, the converter takes that raw data and turns it back into your familiar TypeScript object.

**Why use them?**

- **No more manual mapping:** You don't have to manually pick out each piece of data. The converter does it automatically.
- **Keeps your data safe:** It makes sure the data you read and write always matches the types you defined in your TypeScript code.
- **Handles the ID magic:** Firestore gives each document a unique ID. Converters make it easy to automatically add this ID to your TypeScript object when you read it, and remove it when you save (because Firestore manages the ID itself).
- **Custom transformations:** Need to change a date format or set a default value? Converters let you do that during the translation process.

**How they work (the two main parts):**

Each converter has two important methods:

1. `toFirestore(yourObject)`: **Sending data to Firestore**
   - This method runs when you're saving or updating data in Firestore.
   - It takes your TypeScript object (e.g., a `ScoreData` object) and prepares it for storage.
   - **Example:** You might tell it to ignore the `id` property because Firestore will generate its own.

2. `fromFirestore(snapshot)`: **Getting data from Firestore**
   - This method runs when you're reading data from Firestore.
   - It takes the raw data from a Firestore document (`snapshot`) and rebuilds your TypeScript object.
   - **Example:** This is where you'd typically grab the document's `id` from `snapshot.id` and add it to your `ScoreData` object.

**Let's see an example with `ScoreData`:**

```typescript
// 1. Your TypeScript data model (e.g., in dashboard.models.ts)
export interface ScoreData {
  id: string; // This will be the Firestore document ID
  totalScore: number;
  // ... other fields like githubId, rank, etc.
}

// 2. Your Converter (e.g., also in dashboard.models.ts)
// This tells Firestore how to translate ScoreData objects
export const scoreDataConverter: FirestoreDataConverter<ScoreData> = {
  // When sending ScoreData to Firestore:
  toFirestore: (scoreData: ScoreData): DocumentData => {
    // We don't want to save the 'id' property *in-side* the document,
    // because Firestore uses it as the document's unique identifier.
    const { id, ...rest } = scoreData; // So, we separate 'id' from the rest of the data
    return rest; // And send only the 'rest' of the properties
  },

  // When getting data from Firestore:
  fromFirestore: (snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot, options: SnapshotOptions): ScoreData => {
    const data = snapshot.data(options); // Get the raw data from the document
    return {
      id: snapshot.id, // Take the document's ID and put it into our 'id' property
      totalScore: data['totalScore'],
      // ... map other fields from 'data' to your ScoreData object
    } as ScoreData; // Tell TypeScript this is a ScoreData object
  },
};

// 3. How you'd use it in a service (e.g., in auth.service.ts)
// When you get a reference to a Firestore document, you "attach" the converter to it.
// Now, any read/write operations on this 'studentDocRef' will use scoreDataConverter!
//
// const studentDocRef = doc(this.firestore, `courses/${courseAlias}/students/${githubId}`).withConverter(scoreDataConverter);
// return docData(studentDocRef); // This will automatically give you a ScoreData object!
```
